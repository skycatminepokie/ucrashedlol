This mod lets you mess with the little header on top of crash reports. It won't mess with your crash log in any meaningful way.

To get started, either:
1. Create the config file `.minecraft/config/ucrashedlol.txt` OR
2. Start the game to create the file automagically

If you choose the second option, vanilla comments will be saved. Note that if any more are added to vanilla, the mod will NOT add them to your config. You can delete the config file and startthe game again if you want them.

Every line of your config file is a different text. The game will add `// ` at the beginning for you.

### How do I crash the game?
1. Open a world
2. Hold F3+C for 10 seconds
3. Congratulations, you've crashed Minecraft.
